## Project Title: Skater Showdown

## Getting Started: 

Skater Showdown is an interactive web-based game where players can control a skater and perform tricks, competing against an opponent. The goal is to execute tricks successfully while avoiding wipeouts and accumulating the least number of letters in the word "SKATER."

## Gameplay

- Choose a character (Tony Hawk or Estro Jen) at the beginning of the game.
- Click the "New Trick" button to reveal a random set of tricks.
- Press the corresponding keys to execute the tricks before your opponent does.
- Avoid wipeouts to prevent accumulating letters in the word "SKATER."
- The game continues until one player spells out the entire word "SKATER" and loses.

## Controls

- **Player 1 (Tony Hawk):** Use the provided buttons to control the game.
- **Player 2 (Opponent):** Use the provided buttons to control the game.

## Build Status:
 Here are a few issues with the code that still needs to be worked on:

- After pressing the keys to complete a trick, the code will sometimes skip over certain if statements. 
- The Trick-List does not populate upon choosing a character.
- Extra characters with varying property values has not be configured or added to the game. 
- Additional Animation or Character Pics
- Having the logs populate on the top and not the bottom.
- Make the trick unavailable if you just hold. 
- Adding title above trick-list.
-
